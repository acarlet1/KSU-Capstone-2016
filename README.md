Note: Walmart API key will be removed from the project. A new one will be required.

Before running: 
-Get Walmart API key
-Install Android Studio

How to run:
-Set up emulator and packages as needed
-Launch

To the future:
-Total needs fixed when calling total multiple times, a more dynamic total
-Better names for variables, especially adapters and list views
-Store prices into local storage instead of getting prices on open
-More stores
-Searching issues
-GPS location for local stores (cost for driving distance?)
-Display name of item from JSON instead of what user adds
-Headers (Item, Walmart Price, Amazon Price)
-Sort alphabetically
